# NoesisGUI XAML Tools for Visual Studio Code

This extension provides a rich editing experience for [NoesisGUI](https://www.noesisengine.com/) and the XAML markup language, using the NoesisGUI language server. The latest release of NoesisGUI XAML Tools can be installed from the [Visual Studio Code Marketplace](https://noesisengine.com/vscode).

## NoesisGUI

NoesisGUI is a lightweight cross-platform user interface library optimized for games and real-time applications. It brings the power of XAML and WPF to Unity, Unreal and proprietary engines.

Visit our [Documentation](https://www.noesisengine.com/docs/Gui.Core.Index.html) for more details and our [Forums](https://www.noesisengine.com/forums/) for feedback and suggestions.

## XAML Features

**Completion support for nodes and properties**  

Start typing a XAML tag or attribute and NoesisGUI XAML Tools will show you a list of available symbols (controls, properties, etc.) at that location.

NoesisGUI XAML Tools shows you syntax and semantic errors as you type.

**Live previews**                                 

Open the *XAML Preview* panel and see a rendered preview of the active XAML document. This render is generated by NoesisGUI each time you make a change to the active document.

**Color decorators and pickers**

Color decorators allow you to see the current color of all Brush attribute properties in your document. Clicking a decorator will allow you to select a new value using the color picker.

## Language Server

Visual Studio Code uses language servers to provide "intellisense" capabilities, including diagnostics and completion, for languages. The NoesisGUI language server, which has been created using the NoesisGUI library, provides these capabilities for XAML documents. With NoesisGUI XAML Tools you can either use the embedded NoesisGUI language server, or an external server such as those provided with our Unity and Unreal plugins. When editing XAML documents a server status is shown in the bottom right status bar. When connected, this will show the name of the language server.

**Embedded**

The extension comes packaged with an embedded language server, which will start automatically when a XAML file is detected. This embedded server provides all capabilities, but it is limited to the native NoesisGUI types. For custom type support, an external language server is required.

**External (Unity and Unreal)**

An external language server provides capabilities and type information from the application it is running in. If NoesisGUI XAML Tools detects an external language server, it will automatically connect to it. We provide an external language server in our [Unreal](https://www.noesisengine.com/docs/Gui.Core.UnrealTutorial.html) plugin and [Unity](https://www.noesisengine.com/docs/Gui.Core.Unity3DTutorial.html) package, allowing you to use edit XAML documents for those engines while their Editors are open. 

Note: XAML Preview is not available when connected to Unity or Unreal language servers.
